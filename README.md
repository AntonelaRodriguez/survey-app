# Survey App

Generation of a survey app interface (like Google Forms). The survey responses are sent to a Firebase database and it brings the responses from the aforementioned database to display them in the same app but in another route. When pressing "enviar" in the form, a message must appear and access to that route where the answers will be.

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`
